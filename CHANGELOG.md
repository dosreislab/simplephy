## [0.2.0] - Development
### Added
- Function `jc69.rtmcmc` to perform mcmc sampling of r and t under JC69. Need
to finish documentation.

## [0.1.0] - 2019-02-17
### Added
- Functions to calculate the JC69 likelihood and posterior in a two-species
alignment, when d (the molecular distance) is the parameter to be estimated,
and when t, r (the divergence time and molecular rate, with d = 2rt) are the
parameters to be estimated.
